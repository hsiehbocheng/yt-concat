00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.950
- I spent two and a half million dollars

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.910
on this private jet

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.220
and had 11 YouTubers
put their hands on it.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.900
Whoever keeps their hand on the longest

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.130
wins the private jet,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.860
but if at any point they
take their hand off,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.820
they're eliminated.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.590
The challenge has officially started.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.150
The rules are simple.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
You can't push someone,
and yeah, that's it.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.720
- I've got nothing on the schedule.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.620
I can stay here forever.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.880
- I am willing to do anything,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.100
including crap my own pants.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.150
- I heard there was gonna be a lot

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.680
of loud and obnoxious
people on this shoot.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.950
- Get off.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.783
- No joke,

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:32.160
the winner of this challenge
is getting a private jet.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.007
So of course the old tried
to find the best spot

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.210
- I'm in the best spot, the
lowest spot on the plane.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.320
- I think I've actually got the best spot

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.153
of everyone right now.

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:39.586
- The jet is actually way
bigger than I thought.

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:40.650
Oh. Oh.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.143
- They're making their way on
the other side of the wing-

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:43.230
- How am I gonna do this?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.100
- Just slide your hand.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.480
- Oh. Jimmy!

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.400
- So how comfortable is this position?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.130
I almost just went like,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.415
with my right hand.

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:55.350
- Oh.
- Oh my god.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.850
- George, if you weren't
grabbing something,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.870
I think you might have let go.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.980
- No, I'm locked in. Don't worry.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.690
- Yeah. What's your strategy
for winning this thing?

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.240
- I have a lot of perseverance
in my spirit, but I

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.180
I gotta be honest, Speed...

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.150
Speed is making it difficult.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.610
- Dude, the wheels are pretty comfortable.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.170
- I'm, yeah, you were not.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.030
We're both logical, logical people.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.863
- Exactly.
- I'm rested...

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.828
Oh no.

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:18.727
I think we might have
just got someone out.

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:19.923
- Oh my gosh, Vik's out.

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:22.130
- Did Vik just lose?
- Vik, are you out?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.420
- He really lifted his
hand right in front of him.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.860
- I thought this was a logical spot.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.877
- You guys tell me what you think.

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:28.350
See Vik's hand right there?

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.183
- Yeah.

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:31.410
Yeah.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.930
- This 2.5 million jet isn't yours.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.130
- They'll pick me up when they win.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.570
- Goodbye, Vik.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.250
- Vik, you got out, but who's out next?

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.880
- I think Chunkz.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.919
- Yeah, he looks like
he's petering out there.

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.336
- I think Chunkz is ready to go home.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.640
- Chunkz, buddy.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.080
Word on the street is you wanna leave.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.980
- Potentially.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.780
- Would you get out if I
gave you my debit card?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.040
- What, and it works?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.873
- Yeah, of course.

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:52.230
- No, I swear to god, now I'm tempted.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.637
- Oh, think of the video!

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:55.200
- How much can I spend?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.035
- It'll probably stop
after ten grand, so you-

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:57.868
After ten grand?

00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:58.854
- Yeah.

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:02.135
Oh my God!

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.604
- Here you go.

00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:10.467
I didn't!

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.320
Shut up! I did not do it!

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.726
- Speed's gone! Speed's gone!

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:16.567
- I'll let you be the judge of it.

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:18.630
I'm gonna go forward.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.590
- Where's the date? Where's the date?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.390
- Bro, that's you. Five seconds ago.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.370
So your hand comes in
the frame to high five,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.010
and he just lifts his hand-

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.910
- Chunkz just made 10 grand,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.407
and made Speed leave for nothing.

00:02:28.407 --> 00:02:29.670
- I'm so disappointed.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.350
- That is crazy.
- Oh no.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.834
- Back to back out.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:33.747
What are you looking at?

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:35.430
And this guy keeps following me, man.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.550
- Bye, Speed!

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.600
- We're getting emoted on.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.160
- Three people have been eliminated,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.600
so I'm gonna make things harder.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.450
Conveniently, we rented
this entire airport,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.800
so we're gonna go for a walk.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.633
Karl.
- Yes.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.230
- I need you not to drive too fast.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.730
If you get them all out now,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.110
my video's two minutes long.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.060
- Hey, MrBeast Shortz.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.390
- Oh my God. Are they
about to pull the jet?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.880
- Okay, the plane is moving.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.960
We're moving. We're moving.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.580
- Get comfortable, because
got a long way to go.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.320
- No one's gonna believe
me when I told them

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.153
what we're doing.

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:03.090
- It's not like a private airport,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.566
this is a commercial. I don't
understand how he's done this.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.241
- I'm just so happy we're walking.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:09.828
- Is that fast enough?

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:14.703
- It's a plane, mate.

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:16.650
- If I lose cause I'm
challenged, fair enough.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.940
If I pull a Vik I'm fuming.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.500
- I think my hand's slowly going numb.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.000
- I can't believe we're actually competing

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.080
for a private jet.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.280
- My feet are hurting.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.140
There's a big old warehouse over there.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.550
- Here's our next destination.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.040
Coming up in front.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.720
After two hours in the challenge,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.310
the boys needed a bathroom break.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.540
You wanna test our peeing method?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.500
- How are we ?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.880
- I'll be right back.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.082
Let me introduce you guys to
the good old bucket method.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.520
Hey, keep that hand on.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.230
If this hand comes off, he loses.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.310
I don't care if he's peeing.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.143
- My...

00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:45.976
is out now, by the way.
So don't come around, bro.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.880
I deserve my privacy.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
I missed the bucket.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:53.610
I'm so sorry.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.930
- We don't fake things around here.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.540
Yeah, I just need a good
clean camera shot of his hand.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.040
And throughout this entire challenge,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.320
we have an army of people
staring at their hands.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.790
We'll know if they come off the jet.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.130
- My hand's got a private
jet listening to a man pee.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.800
- Lazar. Can you come on
up to the front over here?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.633
- Ah, how?

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:09.600
- I don't know. Figure it out.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.680
- Guys. Guys, guys.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.900
I'll give you all a ride on
my jet if you let me under.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.340
- Since you have the most subscribers,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.990
you pick the order we go in the jet.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.400
- We're going in reverse order.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.900
- No.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.920
- It's gonna be brutal.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.115
- I'm on the carpet.
Is it that funny, Terry?

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.180
- It's hilarious. He's
literally crawling up here.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.320
- Please let me under. Let me under.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.992
- I'm sorry. We're getting serious now.

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.290
- Wow.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.760
- Might be a bit sticky though.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.593
- Oh.
- Ooh!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.750
- Why's your hand like that?
- What are you doing?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.250
- It's working. Guys, please, please.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.083
- Sorry man.

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.170
- How can I get through?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.737
- Sorry man. You guys, don't push him off.

00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:44.053
It's literally down to fingertips there.

00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:45.193
- No, shut up.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.360
- Oh, this is awful. This is awful.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.770
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.603
- I could see my...

00:04:53.603 --> 00:04:56.610
I mean, my friend flying
up in the sky in this.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.070
- Whoever wins this jet has
to give it to someone else.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.630
'Cause obviously these guys are YouTubers.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.788
They don't need a private jet.

00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:03.150
- It could be you if you
subscribe to my channel.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.983
- If he wins.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.750
- I'm on.
- Yeah.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.721
- So what do you think of the jet, boys?

00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:11.250
Solid.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.760
- There's eight seats and eight
of you, but for us to fly,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.550
I need to sit here, so I kind
of need someone to get out.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.870
- Oh.
- Oh!

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.000
- Just let me know whatever
one of you wants to get out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.840
- All right, Jimmy!

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.670
- I left them alone in the jet for hours,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.700
and no one got out, so I made
them do laps around the plane.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.870
- You start going...

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.240
- Oh, what? I'm gonna
go like under the plane.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.200
- I'm coming over here.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.570
- Someone has to get
out. In case you forgot,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.330
this jet is literally two
and a half million dollars.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.950
These boys got a lot on the line.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.140
- My hand goes off this, I'm done.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.700
- Don't worry, man.
You're just winging it.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.870
- Never speak to me again, please.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.762
- I'm not getting back on that
plane until someone's lost.

00:05:46.457 --> 00:05:47.397
- You need to entice
these guys to leave, man.

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:48.990
- Why? I don't need to.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.740
When you're sleepy, it's game over.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.130
- It's Will. I'm telling you.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.510
Will is the one to go for.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.343
He's cracking.

00:05:55.343 --> 00:05:56.520
- 20K. I'll go.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.870
- I heard some deals are happening.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.703
What's going on?

00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:01.560
They've offered me 20 K from the winner,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.760
if I take my hand off now.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.920
- The winner wins a jet. Not money.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.120
- Are you fine with us making that deal?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.500
- Yeah, if you guys pay him 20 grand.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.928
- Yeah.
- Oh!

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.293
- All right, thank you for...

00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:13.410
Oh my god. That hand's sweaty.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.730
Now that Will is out,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.387
that means we can fly the jet around.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.493
Everyone, get in the jet.

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:26.071
This is nice.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.660
- The inside, the only thing in play

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.710
is the exterior.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.910
The chairs and stuff
like that do not count.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.370
- I'm gonna be honest. I think I'm out.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.720
- What'd you do?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.619
- The chair.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:43.230
- Oh, that's honest of you though.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.450
- Ready?
No, it's got a good angle.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.824
- Definitely not on the wood.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.660
- At least he was honest,
he ratted on himself.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.500
- Thank you, Jimmy.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.670
- No problem. A bit sweaty.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.320
- I know, it hasn't come off the jet.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.981
- Let's see this bad boy in the air.

00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:58.860
Good evening, gentlemen.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.000
Be on our way fairly shortly.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.017
- On our way where, can I ask?

00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:03.390
- Yeah, just, just lay back.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.391
- I'll chill out. I'll chill.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.081
- I really hope you guys didn't, you know,

00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:08.655
when you had your hands
on the outside the plane,

00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:10.095
mess anything up.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:10.928
- What you mean?
- Oh, come on.

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:12.150
- I don't know. I'm just saying.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.230
- If this plane crashes,

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.760
do I get to keep all of their channels?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.140
- Always says the wildest stuff before we-

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.280
- That did not sound good.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.113
- This is it.

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:21.863
- There she goes.

00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:24.007
- In case you're
wondering, this jet works.

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:28.436
- Harry's face kills me.
- It feels wrong.

00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:29.799
It feels like a tin can.

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.023
Anything could hit us out the sky.

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:34.260
- Boys. What way are we going?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.459
- There's a lot of lights that way.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:36.835
So that could be London.

00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:38.376
So we could be going...

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.453
I've got nothing.

00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:43.277
- It's just so funny seeing the wing

00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:45.222
you guys were just slapping...

00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:49.849
- Speed was-
- Oh! Oh!

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:56.948
- We've just got on the flight
and his hand's come off.

00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:57.781
And the best part is,

00:07:57.781 --> 00:07:59.310
he has to fly to the next destination

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.700
and back with us out after he's out.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.450
After over an hour in the air,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.307
I still didn't tell them
where we were going.

00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:07.260
We may or may not be landing soon.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.103
Where do you think we are?

00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:09.482
- I have no idea.
- Dublin.

00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:10.688
- Liverpool.
- Milan.

00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:12.540
- Look for the Eiffel Tower.
- Ireland.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.516
- Scotland.
- I reckon

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:15.123
it's Southend Airport. I
reckon we just did a lap.

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:17.964
- Where are we?
- Where you think about Beast?

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.421
- Oh, whoa.
- Whoa.

00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:21.088
- That's the hangar.

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:23.790
We just did a lap.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.623
- That's right.

00:08:24.623 --> 00:08:26.640
I just told the pilot
to fly around in circles

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.478
for a couple hours.

00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:30.780
Oh, thank god.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.460
- Congratulations, you got pranked.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.483
We went in a circle.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.880
Boys, come on out. This is
where the real fun begins.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.070
Everyone's tired. They're freezing.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.660
The challenge is gonna get interesting.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.463
- In the hangar we go. Again.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.880
- It's time to feed the contestants.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.500
I bought things like steak and spaghetti

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.899
that are really hard to eat with one hand.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.730
- Oh, is that spaghetti?

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.351
- A wooden fork? For a steak.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.673
- After dinner,

00:08:58.673 --> 00:08:59.743
I have a special surprise for all of you.

00:08:59.743 --> 00:09:01.980
See you in a bit.
- Special surprise?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.332
Imagine he says someone's out.

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.410
"I hope you enjoyed that meal."

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.560
We're down to the final five.
It's time we get serious.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.690
I need you guys to pair
up into groups of two.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.920
I'm saying no more.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.030
- Oh, there's only five of us.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.040
- Brother. Yes?
- Me and you both.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.417
Me and you. Come on, we've got this.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.688
- I'm alone. I've been ditched.

00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:19.680
- Karl, you know what to do.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.112
- Left hands

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:23.490
Put 'em together.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.790
- Oh, what is this?

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.020
- I feel like I might have
gotten away with something,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.250
but I don't know what's coming.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.900
Is something happening bad to me?

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:34.122
- Come here, George.

00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:35.310
- I don't know if this is even fair.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.290
They can move their arm.
I can't move my arm.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.910
Oh George. No George.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.743
- I'll just sit here.

00:09:39.743 --> 00:09:42.300
- If Lazar wins, a nine
year old kid gets the jet.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.430
If Niko wins, his editor gets the jet.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.650
- When I was five, I was really ill.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.350
I had leukemia, so I'm gonna find someone,

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.320
and try and give them the
start that I didn't have

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.190
after that.
- Wow.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.298
- Yeah, I was trying to change-

00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:55.860
- So you'll find someone
who recovers from leukemia,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.693
give them a jet?
- Yeah.

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:57.526
I'm gonna try my best.

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:59.400
- I would find someone who's
willing to sell the jet,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.380
and then donate all that
money to a children's charity.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.213
- Really?
- No.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.150
- We are bonded forever after this.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.170
Is this all right?

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.570
- Me and Mr. Lazar have
found the best position.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.700
- I met you 24 hours ago. Now look at us.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.505
- Lean your head on my
chest, turn to the side,

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:14.338
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:14.338 --> 00:10:15.171
- Aw, man.
- There you go.

00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:16.263
- How's it going on down there?

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:18.210
- Our little .

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.030
- This is literally the biggest
prize I've ever given away,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.040
and they're starting to get
a little too comfortable.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.930
I banned the wings to make it harder,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.910
but it doesn't seem like that's working.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.913
They have 60 seconds to stand up.

00:10:28.913 --> 00:10:31.530
- I think I know what's
coming and it's not good.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.240
- Okay, everyone is standing again.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.130
- Yes. Let's go with the routine.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.050
- Since nobody was getting out,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.610
I'm gonna bring out the red tape.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.130
I decided to give them
even less room on the jet.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.620
If you touch the red line, or go below it,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.910
you are out, starting now.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.900
We're in this together.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.967
Let's see how badly they want this jet.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.990
- You allowed to do that?

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.730
- What?
- Hold your hand.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.630
- Why not?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.620
- No wonder you haven't moved.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.656
You've been holding it in place.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.770
- We've been doing this
for like an hour now,

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.780
and everyone is still
kind of going strong.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.460
I guess Harry's looking a bit wobbly.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.970
- It's 5:00 AM I think I'm
more tired than they are.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.930
- We have a proposition.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.440
I'm gonna coin flip this
young gentleman over here.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.797
Whoever loses takes
their hand off the jet.

00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:18.668
- Heads, you stay on, tails you stay on,

00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:22.987
a $2.5 million jet on the line.

00:11:22.987 --> 00:11:24.560
- Oh my God.
- Oh hell, watch out.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.526
Oh!

00:11:28.526 --> 00:11:29.982
- Get off the jet.
- It's on heads.

00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:31.470
- Get off the jet!

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.357
- Is he a man of his word?

00:11:33.357 --> 00:11:35.916
- Oh!

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.580
- How does it feel to be free?

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.507
- It's very not...

00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:41.310
But I miss him, man. I miss my boy.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.247
- I believe in you.
Harry. Hold that hand up.

00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:44.228
See you later.
- Little bit.

00:11:44.228 --> 00:11:45.420
- See ya, boys. I'm going to bed.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.290
- I wish I could.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.910
To celebrate Callux getting out,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.200
I say we make it harder.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.850
Everyone pick a finger.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.930
- This beauty here.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.850
- As of now, that is, is all that matters.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.720
- I'm gonna go with the pointer.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.070
- Okay. Pointer as well.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.240
Everyone's pointer finger.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.150
From now on, that is the
only finger that matters,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.620
till you guys start dropping.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.550
- I'm not good.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.570
- It's so difficult now.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.867
- This is painful. I'm only 10 seconds in.

00:12:05.867 --> 00:12:07.680
- I have the benefit of
this other hand there.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.450
- We need to get our tape
off to be fair with Harry.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.430
- Give it like 30 minutes and
I'll cut all the tape off.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.540
- Can I coin flip it?

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.830
Take my tape off if I get heads?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.850
- If you'll leave. Sure.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.620
- Let's flip the coin. Heads, take it off.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.213
I'm doing this for you, Niko.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.210
- Tails. That means he's out.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.190
- I didn't have a chance
unless we took this tape off.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.112
Oh, I'm sorry Niko. You've
gotta take it home, buddy.

00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:31.200
It's for Niko.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.033
- It's for Niko.
- Oh my God.

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:33.120
- Take it home, buddy.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.953
- I'll let you pick.

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:35.610
Do we make George wait the 30 minutes,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.600
or do I cut him out now?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800
- I wanna see a fair ending.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.633
Take it off. Take it off.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.020
- Okay, I appreciate that.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.970
- I wanna see a of willpower.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.810
- Good luck.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.970
Keep your finger on the jet.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.830
- This is what I needed for me to win.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.660
- It's gonna be so
disrespectful when you lose.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.493
- If you win.

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:50.670
Who is getting this jet?

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.200
- I think it's just
gonna have to be my mom.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.250
I've got no one else.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.840
- I really want to give
it to my editor, George.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.220
- We should call your editor.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.810
George. What's up man?

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.643
- Oh my gosh.

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:00.780
- Now, Niko is saying that if he wins,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.340
he's giving this jet to you.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.200
Do you have any words of
encouragement for Niko?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.069
- Encouragement is you've gone this far.

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:07.460
You can go the extra mile.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.030
- Thank you, George. Thank you.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.430
- I'm gonna split it between
my brother and my sister.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.263
- Oh really?

00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:13.096
- I grew up with them, man,

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:15.336
so I wanna try and give
them something special.

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:16.200
The sun's coming through out there.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.090
I'm seeing daylight.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.980
That's the only way we can
actually tell the time.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.090
This is very tough.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.410
- My arm is dying.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.730
- You ready to make this a little harder?

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.237
I need you to face that direction.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.493
Oh look, I've done it.

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:28.080
- Yeah yeah. There you go.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.190
- I'm like losing...

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.360
- Oh, I should just gone like that.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.740
- Yeah. There we go.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.275
Niko is struggling here.

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:35.248
- Just get out already.
- I can't.

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:36.847
- Come on.

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:38.370
- Now's not the time, Nolan.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.780
- I left them alone for a while

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.972
and then we caught something
on one of our cameras.

00:13:41.972 --> 00:13:43.244
- One of you-
- Oh no, oh no...

00:13:43.244 --> 00:13:44.310
- has gotten out.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.227
Who do you think it is?

00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:46.110
- It's me!

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.520
- Someone go review his footage.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.253
It was not, I got something
I need to show you.

00:13:49.253 --> 00:13:50.433
Is that your hand?

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.610
- Maybe?

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.110
- Is that your hand?
- That is my hand.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.496
- It was literally off, for
no joke, one singular frame.

00:13:59.496 --> 00:14:00.329
- I gotta take my hand off?

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:01.830
- Well, I mean you can leave it on,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.743
but you're not winning the jet, man.

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:04.750
Aw, guys.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.031
- There was clear airspace. Wow.

00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:06.890
Well played, guys.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.230
- It is now down to George and Harry.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.550
- I want you to check though.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.870
- I'm going to check Harry.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.937
- Can't believe I was
this close to win it.

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.620
Who do I think's gonna win?

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.453
I feel like-

00:14:17.453 --> 00:14:18.930
- Who do you think's gonna win?

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.830
What do you mean?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.783
How about here's who did win.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.290
Don't tell 'em who it is.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.155
Gentlemen. The challenge
is officially over.

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.095
- No, I know when it happened,

00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:33.660
a minute before you came
out, it skipped over, no!

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.710
- Harry.
- No!

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.543
- I'm sorry man.

00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:37.014
But you can go ahead and
take your finger off.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.330
If you look right here.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.890
See that finger?
- Mhm.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.930
- It's not Harry's.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.000
It's actually George's.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.470
- No.
- Wait. You're trolling.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.910
You actually trolled me.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.743
- Yeah. Harry?

00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:51.437
You just won!

00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:52.687
- Yes! Come on!

00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:55.808
Oh yeah!

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.101
- George, you were this close.

00:15:00.101 --> 00:15:00.960
- What?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.700
- But close doesn't matter.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.813
Harry just won this jet!

00:15:04.813 --> 00:15:07.140
- Yes!
- Oh, you're all so sweaty.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.320
Congratulations. Who are
you giving the jet to?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.880
My brother and my sister.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.050
Let's go to them right now.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.950
- Three, two, one.

00:15:18.492 --> 00:15:20.157
- No no no no...
- I swear to God.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.590
Subscribe to MrBeast. He's a legend.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.060
Buy all his chocolate and stuff.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.410
- Everything.
- And in case you're wondering

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.240
we're gonna offset all the carbon emitted

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.580
during the filming of
this video by tenfold.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.100
And we're also gonna offset
any future carbon emitted

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.973
by the winner of this jet.
